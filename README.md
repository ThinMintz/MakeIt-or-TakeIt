# MakeIt-or-TakeIt

Let’s say you are hungry and you are in the mood for Italian food, you look in the pantry and have some pasta, but don’t really know what you want. You log onto **Make it or Take it** and enter your cuisine choice (Italian). Then you enter what you have on hand (pasta) and click on the **Make it** button. Instantly, four meals with pictures pop up and you can click on any picture to take you to the recipe. But maybe after looking at the recipes, you starting thinking, how tired you are and you just want some hot food delivered to you. You can click on the **Take it** button and 6 nearby restaurants based on the cuisine you selected, and your zip code will return. You then click on a restaurant to be taken to the website and order some take out.

This is the premise of **Make it or Take it!**
